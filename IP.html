            <h2>IP Addresses, Packets, and Routing</h2>
            <h5>What is an IP Address?</h5>
            <p>
                IP stands for Internet Protocol. The internet is actually a design philosophy and an architecture
                expressed in a set of protocols.
            </p>
            <p>A protocol is a well known set of rules and standards used to communicate across machines. In order for a
                new technology to use the internet, it just needs to know which protocols to work with.
            </p>
            <p>Every device has a different addresses, which is a set of numbers unique to each device on the network.
                The addressing system for computers on the internet forms the internet protocol or IP.
            </p>
            <p>*** insert ip address description picture**</p>
            <p>An IP address is a group of numbers, organized in a hierarchy. Each number is made up of bits; there are
                normally 32 bits or 8 bits per each part of the address.</p>
            <p>The numbers are broken down by networks, subnetworks, and finally the specific address. This naming
                convention is called IPv4 and it provides for more than 4 billion unique addresses. With the tremendous
                growth in both internet users and devices, IPv4 will not have enough unique addresses to last. We are
                transitioning to a longer IP address format called IPv6, which will use 128 bits per address. This
                provides 340 undecillion unique addresses, or more than enough for every grain of sand on earth to have
                its own address.
            </p>
            <p>Visiting a website is really just your computer asking another computer for information. Your computer
                sends a message to the other computer's IP address and it also sends its origin address so the other
                computer knows where to send information to.</p>

            <h5>What is a Packet?</h5>
            <p></p>
            <img class="card-img-top" src="images/facebook.png" alt="Card image cap">
            <p>A packet is a piece of information that is routed from one computer to another. Packets are used to
                deliver data reliably.They include the origin and destination addresses.</p>
            <p>You can think of a packet like a car. The packet moves the data from the origin to its destination. The
                way that the information is transferred is not a fixed path. A packet may change its path based upon
                many reasons, just as you would change in your path while driving depending upon a circumstance like
                traffic or road conditions.</p>
            <p>Many types of information can be sent with packets, but there are some size limits. If there is have a
                large amount of data, the information you are trying to send may be too much for one packet. To resolve
                this problem, the information is broken into many smaller packets.</p>
            </p>

    <h5>What is a Router?</h5>
    <p></p>
    <img class="card-img-top" src="images/facebook.png" alt="Card image cap">
    <p>A router is a device that directs the signal to/from multiple computers to multiple internet sites. Routers act
        like traffic managers to keep packets moving through the network smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>	Different packets may take different routes and they may arrive at the destination at different times or out of order. As part of the IP, routers keep track of many paths for sending packets. They choose the cheapest path to get the data to its destination. In this case, cheapest does not mean least expensive. Cheapest considers time, politics, and relationships between companies. Often times, the best route for data to travel is not the most direct. Because there are path options, the internet is fault tolerant meaning the internet can keep sending packets even if something goes horribly wrong somewhere. This equals reliability!
