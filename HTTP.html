            <h2>HTTP and HTTPS Protocols</h2>
            <h5>What is HTTP?</h5>
            <p>HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is the data transfer protocol used by the World Wide
                Web, or the language that one computer uses to ask another for a document. So, in a web browser, you
                would type in the URL and hit enter. Your computer then startes talking to another computer called a
                server. Your computer requests your desired website from the server, and the server answers the computer
                using HTTP. </p>
            <img class="card-img-top" src="images/http.jpg" alt="Card image cap">
            <p><small>This diagram depicts how HTTP requests are sent.</small></p>
            <div class="row">
                <p> HTTP is mainly made up of "GET" requests. To get to the Tumbler Login page, your computer would say
                    GET/, followed by the Tumblr login page information. Essentially the computer is asking for all of
                    the
                    HTML code for the login page. You can learn about HTML <a href="W3C.html" class="text">here.</a> One
                    thing to note is that images and videos for a site are not included in the HTML code. They are
                    separate
                    files with their own URLs and need to be requested. The browser sends separate requests for the
                    images
                    and videos and they populate as they arrive. Each image or video causes its own HTTP request, which
                    causes the page to load slower.
                </p>
                <p>Sometimes when you browse the web you actually send information, like when filling out a form or
                    typing a
                    search query. Your browser transfers this information via a POST request. Based on the information
                    sent,
                    the server will send back the corresponding webpage. For example, if John logs into Tumblr, he would
                    receive his Tumblr Account Homepage back. There is also cookie data sent that your browser sees and
                    knows how to save. Cookie data is like an ID card that lets the web browser remember who you are.
                </p>


                <h5>What is HTTPS?</h5>

                    <p>HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is an extension of HTTP used for secure
                        communication over the internet.</p>
                    <p>The internet is open, and information is sent in plain text. This makes information sent through
                        the web able to be exposed to hackers! Safe websites prevent snooping by communicating on a
                        secure channel using Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) and Transport Layer Security(TLS). SSL and TLS
                        are a layer of security wrapped around your communications and are represented by the lock next
                        to the
                        HTTPS. HTTPs uses public key encryption to exchange data with the website you are using. Public
                        key cryptography is the foundation of all secure messaging on open internet. Computers use
                        asymmetric keys; a public key that can be exchanged with anybody and a private key that is not
                        shared. The public key is used to encrypt data and anybody can use it to create a secret
                        message. The
                        secret can only be decrypted by a computer with access to the private key. Public key
                        cryptography includes SSL and TLS protocols to protect us when browsing the web.

                    <p><small>This diagram decribes HTTPS.</small></p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p> When a website asks your browser to engage securely, it provides a digital certificate,
                            which is
                            like an official ID card proving it is the website that it claims to be. Certificates are
                            given
                            by
                            certificate authorities which are trusted entities that verify the identities of websites
                            and
                            issue
                            certificates for them.
                            If a website starts to send a transmission without a verified certificate your browser will
                            warn
                            you. It is important to pay attention to this to prevent information from getting into the
                            wrong
                            hands! </p>
